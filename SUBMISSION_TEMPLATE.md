## Project Description (≈170 words)
CyberSafe is a simple, trustworthy web platform that helps students and senior citizens recognize and avoid common cyber frauds such as phishing emails, fake OTP/UPI requests, and lottery/processing-fee scams. The app has three parts: (1) Awareness tips written in plain language with real examples; (2) an interactive “Spot the Scam” quiz that teaches users how to think before they click; and (3) a lightweight scam-message detector that flags risky keywords, links, urgency phrases, and requests for sensitive information. Our goal is to make cyber safety easy to understand and act upon, especially for non-technical users. The design is minimal and readable, so it can run on any device. In future iterations, we plan to add regional languages, verified resource links, API-based reporting, and a small ML classifier trained on phishing datasets. CyberSafe aims to raise awareness, build good habits, and empower users to verify before they share or pay — reducing financial loss and identity theft in the community.
